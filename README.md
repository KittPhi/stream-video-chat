# Stream a Video Chat With Vonage Video API

This series of tutorials will explore the [Vonage Video API (formerly TokBox OpenTok)](https://tokbox.com/developer/) and what you can build with it. The Video API is very robust and highly customisable, and in each post, weâ€™ll show how to implement a specific feature using the API. This time we will look at how to stream your video chat to an audience who is not in the chat.

We will not be using any front-end frameworks for this series, just vanilla Javascript to keep the focus on the Video API itself. At the end of this tutorial, your video chat application should also provide an option to simply watch the video chat stream.
